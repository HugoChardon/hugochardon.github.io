## About me
I am a 4th year PhD student at CREST-ENSAE, working under the supervision of [Matthieu Lerasle](http://lerasle.perso.math.cnrs.fr/index.html) and [Jaouad Mourtada](https://jaouadmourtada.github.io).  
I am also teaching coordinator at ENSAE for Statistics and Machine Learning courses.

## Research interests
My current work is on non-asymptotic logistic regression. I am broadly interested in statistical learning theory, empirical processes and concentration inequalities.
