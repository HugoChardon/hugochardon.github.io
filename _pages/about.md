### About me
I am a Neyman Visiting Assistant Professor in the Department of Statistics at UC Berkeley. Prior to that, I completed my PhD at CREST-ENSAE, under the supervision of [Matthieu Lerasle](http://lerasle.perso.math.cnrs.fr/index.html) and [Jaouad Mourtada](https://jaouadmourtada.github.io). I defended my Ph.D. on June 26, 2025. The manuscript can be found [here](https://hugochardon.github.io/files/Manuscrit-HC.pdf).

I was also teaching coordinator at ENSAE for Statistics and Machine Learning courses.

### Research interests
My current work is on non-asymptotic logistic regression. I am broadly interested in statistical learning theory, empirical processes and concentration inequalities.
